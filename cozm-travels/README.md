---

## 3. Authentication

The API requires a **Bearer token** and a custom **Version header**.

### Request Headers

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
Version: FRAGOMEN
```

The version is currently hard-coded to `FRAGOMEN`.

## 4. API Endpoints

### a. üîê Authentication

`POST /api/users/token/`

Retrieves three tokens:

- `access_token` ‚Äì *(not needed)*
- `id_token` ‚Äì **Used as Bearer token**
- `refresh_token` ‚Äì *(not needed)*

#### Request Fields

| Key        | Type     | Required | Description   | Value             |
|------------|----------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| `email`    | `string` | Yes      | User email    | **redacted**      |
| `password` | `string` | Yes      | User password | **redacted**      |

#### Example (cURL)

```
curl --location 'https://api.development.cozmtravels.democozm.com/api/users/token/' \
     --header 'Version: FRAGOMEN' \
     --form 'email="**redacted**"' \
     --form 'password="**redacted**"'
```

The returned `id_token` needs to be used as the Bearer token in further requests.

---

### b. üìÑ Form Fields

`GET /api/compliance/fields`

Retrieves dynamic fields for A1 applications based on:

- `country`: Country for which the form is requested (e.g. `US`)
- `form_type`: Form type (e.g. `COC`)

#### Query Parameters

| Key            | Type     | Required | Description                                          |
|----------------|----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `country`      | `string` | Yes      | 2-letter ISO code of the country (e.g. `US`)         |
| `form_type`    | `string` | Yes      | Form/Compliance type (e.g. `COC`, `MSW-A1`, `A1`)    |

#### Example (cURL)

```
curl --location 'https://api.development.cozmtravels.democozm.com/api/compliance/fields?country=US&form_type=COC' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN' \
     --header 'Version: FRAGOMEN'
```

### Compliance Types

The API supports several types of compliance forms that can be used with the `/api/compliance/fields` endpoint:

| Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `A1`    | Standard A1 certificate for EU social security coverage during temporary work assignments within the EU/EEA/Switzerland. Required for single-country postings. |
| `MSW-A1`| Multi-State Worker A1 certificate for employees regularly working in multiple EU countries. Covers social security compliance across multiple jurisdictions.   |
| `COC`   | Certificate of Coverage for social security agreements with non-EU countries. Maintains social security coverage during overseas assignments.            |
| `ETA`   | Electronic Travel Authorization for temporary entry into specific countries. Required for business travel to certain destinations.                            |
| `BV`    | Business Visa application for temporary business activities in foreign countries. Required for specific business-related activities abroad.                   |

These compliance types can be used as the `form_type` parameter when calling the `/api/compliance/fields` endpoint to retrieve the appropriate form fields. For example:

```
GET /api/compliance/fields?country=US&host_country=DE&form_type=COC
```

The response will contain all required fields specific to that compliance type and country.

### Field Attributes Explained

The main key returned by the API call above is the `fields` array.
Each element of this array roughly represents one question asked on the corresponding questionnaire
and contains a number of attributes which are described below.

The set of fields in the `fields` array is different for each country and form type.

| Attribute            | Description                                                                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`               | Internal field identifier used as key (e.g. `employee_first_name`)                           |
| `type`               | Data format or UI control, see below for more information (e.g. `string`, `date`, `boolean`) |
| `group`              | Logical grouping, mostly used on the UI (e.g. `Personal details`)                            |
| `description`        | The actual question in human-readable format (e.g. "First name")                             |
| `persona`            | Role the field is meant for (see below)                                                      |
| `required`           | `true` or `false` ‚Äì indicates if field is mandatory                                          |
| `max_length`         | Maximum number characters allowed (only relevant for `string` inputs)                        |
| `choices`            | Predefined dropdown label-value pairs (one of which must be used as the value when sending a request). The label has to be displayed to the user, and the corresponding value has to be sent in the API request payload.   |
| `parent_value`       | Used in conditional logic. The field only needs to be specified in the payload, if the parent field's value matches this.                    |
| `conditional_fields` | Nested fields, relevant depending on the current field's value                               |
| `placeholder`        | Placeholder text shown to user (e.g. "John", only used on the UI)                            |
| `extra_validations`  | Regex or additional validations, the value for this field needs to pass the validation       |

### Persona Types

| Persona         | Description                                                                  |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Employee`      | Field to be filled by the employee or traveler                               |
| `Employer`      | Field to be completed by the employer and visible to the employee            |
| `Employer only` | Field to be completed by the employer and invisible to the employee          |
| `Assumption`    | Data that can be pre-filled (e.g. nationality, country of residence)         |

#### Signature Format

If the form includes signature fields, they must drawn on a canvas and the image must be **Base64-encoded**:

```json
"employee_signature": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUA..."
```

#### Uploaded Files

Any uploaded files must be included in the `uploaded_files` array.

The `uploaded_files` array contains objects with the name and `aws_object_key` of the uploaded files.

```json
"uploaded_files": [
    {
        "name": "CamScanner 12-20-2024 18.42.jpg",
        "aws_object_key": "5adabe96-4bd8-415a-8b47-878db6019abc"
    },
    {
        "name": "CamScanner 12-20-2024 18.42.jpg",
        "aws_object_key": "83f908fa-6992-414e-9c39-dcef8fbf14f9"
    }
]
```

---

## 5. üîÑ Conditional Fields Logic

The form uses **conditional fields** to dynamically display form inputs based on user responses. Each conditional field is linked to a parent field and only appears when the parent has a specific value (`parent_value`).

The form also supports recursive conditional logic to allow the addition of multiple host countries for Multi-state (MSW-A1) applications.

This logic ensures that users only see fields relevant to their situation, making the form cleaner and easier to complete.

### Structure Example

```json
{
  "name": "parent_field",
  "type": "string",
  "conditional_fields": [
    {
      "name": "child_field",
      "type": "string",
      "parent_value": "Expected Value"
    }
  ]
}
```

This logic helps:
- Show only relevant fields
- Support dynamic forms
- Handle nested, multi-step inputs (e.g., MSW-A1)
